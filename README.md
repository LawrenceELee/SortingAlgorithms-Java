A library of basic sorting algorithms written in Java.

#####Comparison based sorts - lower bounds (Big Omega)of n lg n runtime
```
* Selection sort - runtime tends towards n^2 (worst)
* Insertion sort - runtime between n and n^2
* Merge sort - runtime usually n lg n. O(n lg n) (worst, avg)
* Quick sort - runtime usually n lg n. worst: O(n^2) , best: O(n lg n), avg: O(n lg n)
* Quick3 sort - runtime between n and n lg n. worst: O(n^2), best: O(n), avg: O(n lg n)

* Quick select

```
#####Non comparison based sorts - lower bound n runtime
* Radix sort (least significant digit first, most significant digit first)
* Bucket sort
```

```
* Heap sort

* Topological sort
```
